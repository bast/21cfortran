Before you start
================

Fortran is a compiled language so we will need a compiler.
It will be useful to install GFortran and CMake.

On Debian-like distributions::

  $ sudo apt-get install gfortran cmake

GFortran and CMake are free. It is no problem to use a Fortran compiler
provided by another vendor instead of GFortran (Intel, PGI, Cray, XL).
